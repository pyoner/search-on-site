Here are a few more examples:\n\n```\n!deepl :de How are you?\n```\nTranslates \"How are you?\" into German.\n\n```\n!deepl :es What's the weather like today?\n```\nTranslates \"What's the weather like today?\" into Spanish.\n\nFeel free to replace the language codes (`:fr` for French, `:de` for German, `:es` for Spanish, etc.) to translate into other supported languages."

The `!npm` bang simply redirects your query to npm's search page with the search term you provide. Advanced search functionalities would have to be utilized through the npm website itself.\n\nFor instance, you could refine your search result using keywords and filters directly on npm's search page, but these are not directly supported through the bang syntax."

This provides a classic interface for users who prefer the traditional Reddit experience.\n\n## Usage\nTo search for a subreddit using the old.reddit.com interface, use the bang `!ors` followed by the subreddit name or topic of interest.\n\n## Example\n```\n!ors programming\n```\n\n## Result\nThis will direct you to the old Reddit interface for the \"programming\" subreddit:\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/programming](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming)\n\n## Advanced Search Operators\nOld Reddit does not inherently support all of Reddit's advanced search operators within its interface, but you can still use some basic Reddit search features as follows:\n    \n- **Keyword Searches:** Simply type your keyword to find posts containing that term.\n- **Author Searches:** Use `author:username` to find posts by a specific user.\n- **Domain Searches:** Use `site:example.com` to find posts containing links to a specific domain.\n\nGiven that you're directed to the subreddit itself with `!ors`, you may want to refine searches using Reddit's built-in search bar once there.\n\n### Example of Advanced Search\n1. **Searching for posts by a specific user in a subreddit:**\n    ```\n    !ors programming author:JaneDoe\n    ```\n    This redirects you to the programming subreddit, where you can then include `author:JaneDoe` in the old Reddit search bar.\n\n2. **Searching for posts containing links to a specific domain:**\n    ```\n    !ors programming site:github.com\n    ```\n    Again, this takes you to the programming subreddit where \"site:github.com\" can be added to refine your search within old Reddit.\n\nUtilize these techniques for a more targeted approach in your searches while using old.reddit.com."

It is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, aimed at creating a reliable and useful worldwide travel guide that is maintained by volunteers.\n\n## Usage\nTo search for travel guides on Wikivoyage, you can use the DuckDuckGo bang `!wv` followed by your search term. This will redirect you to the relevant Wikivoyage search results.\n\n## Example\n```\n!wv Paris\n```\n\n## Result\nThis will take you to the Wikivoyage search results page for \"Paris,\" where you can find various travel guides, destination overviews, and useful travel information about Paris.\n\n## Advanced Search Operators\nWikivoyage itself does not have unique advanced search operators, but combining DuckDuckGo's search capabilities with the `!wv` bang can be a powerful tool. Here are some DuckDuckGo advanced search tips:\n- Use quotes to search for an exact phrase: `!wv \"Eiffel Tower\"`\n- Use `intitle:` to find pages with a specific word in the title: `!wv intitle:Museum`\n- Use `-` to exclude certain terms: `!wv New York -City`\n\nThis will allow you to refine your searches more effectively within Wikivoyage using DuckDuckGo's capabilities."
